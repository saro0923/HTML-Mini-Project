      <hr>
      <p>The first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901 by The Enfield Cycle Company of Redditch, Worcestershire, England, which was responsible for the design and original production of the Royal Enfield Bullet, the longest-lived motorcycle design in history.Licensed from the original English Royal Enfield by the indigenous Indian Madras Motors, the company is now a subsidiary of Eicher Motors, an Indian automaker.The company makes classic-looking motorcycles including the Royal Enfield Bullet, Classic 350, Royal Enfield Thunderbird, Meteor 350, Classic 500, Interceptor 650, Continental, Hunter 350 and many more.

      <img src="img/gt650.jpg">
      <p>The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 is a parallel twin retro-styled motorcycle introduced by Royal Enfield in 2018. It is the first modern twin cylinder motorcycle developed by the company.</p>
      <p>In 2017 it was revealed, inspired by the 1960s Interceptor which had a 750cc engine. The Interceptor 650 was unveiled alongside the Continental GT 650, which shares the same engine. The Interceptor is a retro-cruiser with relaxed ergonomics, while the Continental GT is a café-racer with minor changes for performance. Both models are sold in India, Australasia, Europe and the United States. The bike is expected to become the biggest selling large-capacity twin in the world,[1] and in 2020 the Interceptor 650 was the UK's best-selling big bike.</p>
      <h2>Café-racer</h2>
      <img src="img/cafe.png">
      <p>The updated Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 takes its inspiration from the 1970s era of British motorcycling, with its cast alloy wheels and blacked-out aesthetic. Alongside its classically-styled, '50s and '60s-inspired predecessors, it recaptures the spirit of the cafe racer culture of the time and that of our own Continental GT 250. With its sculpted tank, eager attitude and tucked-in riding position, it carries all the hallmarks of a traditional café racer, making it perfect for carving up the back roads or having a ton of fun in the city</p>
      <h2>All Black</h2>

      <p>The new, all-black Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 streamlines the retro café racer with its subtle yet stylish aesthetic. The blacked-out engine and exhaust fuse seamlessly with the machine's chassis, keeping the spotlight on its tank for a look that is guaranteed to make hearts race and heads turn.</p>
      <h2>648cc of Fun</h2>

      <p>The GT 650 showcases Royal Enfield's legendary parallel twin-cylinder engine, backed with an air/oil-cooled parallel twin configuration. The 648cc engine offers 47 horsepower at 7150 RPM and a maximum of 52 Nm of torque at 5250 RPM. A smooth throttle response throughout the rev range ensures sufficient power to make light work of the city traffic or carve up the corners.</p>
      <h2>Ton of Fun</h2>
      <img src="img/gt fun.jpg">
      <p>The frame of the motorcycle, developed in conjunction with the legendary Harris Performance, has been thoroughly tested for durability and offers superior balance and handling. Together with a finely tuned suspension featuring ‘piggy-back’ gas-charged twin shocks, the chassis ensures that the GT 650 is a dynamic, lively and agile ride.</p>
